# Week 1: Python Data Challenges

This repository contains the solutions to a set of Python-based tasks designed to practice data handling, logic implementation, and analysis using both script-based and notebook-based formats.

## 📁 Structure

- `Challenge2.py` - Solution for Task 2
- `Challenge4.ipynb` - Notebook-based solution for Task 4
- `Challengemain.py` - Main script integrating parts of the challenge
- `Challengepart1.py` - Sub-part of the main challenge (Task 1)
- `Challengepart2.py` - Sub-part of the main challenge (Task 1)
- `Challengepart3.py` - Sub-part of the main challenge (Task 1)
- `Task1(Main).py` - Consolidated solution for Task 1
- `Data.csv`, `b.csv` - Input datasets used across tasks
- `report.txt` - Additional explanation or findings

## ✅ Task List and Descriptions

### 🔹 Task 1: Data Parsing and Processing
**Files**: `Task1(Main).py`, `Challengepart1.py`, `Challengepart2.py`, `Challengepart3.py`

- Load and parse CSV data.
- Perform data transformation and filtering.
- Output cleaned or processed results.

### 🔹 Task 2: Custom Challenge Implementation
**File**: `Challenge2.py`

- Solve a custom logic problem (e.g., string manipulation, pattern recognition).
- Display results with appropriate formatting.

### 🔹 Task 3: Integrated Challenge
**File**: `Challengemain.py`

- Combine multiple challenge parts into a cohesive program.
- Modular implementation calling `Challengepart*.py`.

### 🔹 Task 4: Data Exploration (Notebook)
**File**: `Challenge4.ipynb`

- Use Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization.
- Document steps, findings, and insights with markdown cells.

## 📊 Datasets

- `Data.csv`: Main dataset used across challenges.
- `b.csv`: Secondary dataset, possibly for comparison or merging.

## 📌 Notes

- Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
- Install Jupyter Notebook if you want to run the `.ipynb` file.
- Use `pandas`, `numpy`, and standard libraries as needed.

## 🛠️ How to Run

To execute Task 1:
```bash
python Task1(Main).py
